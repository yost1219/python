Lab 3C: The "Fun" House

Instructions

Create a text-based game where the user is navigating through a "Fun" House. Prompt the user to make a decision and using if/elif/else statements, give them different outcomes based on their answers. Begin with an introduction to your fun house and prompt the user to choose between at least three different options. You can use nested if/elif/else statements to make the game more complex.
Requirments

    Adhere to PEP8 (Comments, formatting, style, etc)
    Utilize userinput
    Utilize proper formatting
    Utilize proper and clean if/elif/else statements
    Follow instructions above

Additional

    Take this a step further. Use some previous concepts. Here are some things you can do:
        Create a file that holds all of your prompts
        Store file prompts into a list, dict, etc
        Use if/elif/else statements to validate user input
        Use formatting to create UI elements and/or fancy prompts
        Use operators and user input to perform calculations based on prompts
        etc

Example:

print "Welcome to Fun House! Choose door 1, 2, or 3..."

input = raw_input("> ")

if input == "1":
    #<code>
    print"1"

elif input == "2":
    #<code>
    print "2"

elif input == "3":
    #<code>
    print "3"
else:
    print "Go home you're drunk."
